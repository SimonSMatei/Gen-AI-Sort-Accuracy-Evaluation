# Project Overview
This research project evaluates the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of various Large Language Models (LLMs) when tasked with basic algorithmic operations—specifically, sorting numerical lists. While Generative AI excels at semantic tasks, its ability to perform strict logical operations on token sequences remains a subject of active research. This project quantifies the error rate of models (specific models to be decided) as input complexity increases.

### Objectives
* **Accuracy Benchmarking:** Measure the sort accuracy of different models across varying list lengths (n=10, 100, 500) and the sort accuracy of sorting a list with guaranteed duplicate numbers.
* **Hallucination Detection:** Identify specific failure modes, such as dropped numbers and hallucinated values.

### Methodology
* **Data Generation:** A random list of integers (1-10 for duplicate list and 1-10,000 for the rest) with specified lengths are generated by ***Get_Lists.py*** and stored in respective files.
* **Model Inference:** Lists are passed to model APIs via a standardized prompt template requesting a sorted output.
* **Validation:** The response is then compared to the true sorted list and the errors are stored in respective files.
* **Modeling and Statistics:** Errors are passed through a script to visualize and gather wanted statistical analysis.

### Tech Stack
* **Development Environment:** Google Antigravity (Agentic IDE)
* **Language:** Python 3.13.2
* **Models Tested:** TBD
* **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib
